I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca) in the SCALE-AI Chair Team supervized by [Thibaut Vidal](https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/en/home-thibaut-vidal.html).
Prior to that, I was a PhD student jointly at [INRIA Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/fr) in the SIMSMART team and at [INSA Rennes](https://www.groupe-insa.fr) in the Applied Mathematics Department under the supervizion of [Cédric Herzet](https://cherzet.github.io), [Clément Elvira](https://c-elvira.github.io), and [Ayse-Nur Arslan](https://aysnrarsln.github.io).
Before, I earned an Engineering degree (M.Sc. equivalent) specialized Applied Mathematics from [INSA Rennes](https://www.groupe-insa.fr) where I followed a research cursus that allowed me to collaborate with researchers for two years before graduating.

I mainly work on mixed-integer and convex optimization problems linked to Machine learning and signal processing applications. You can visit my [website](https://theoguyard.github.io) for more details.
