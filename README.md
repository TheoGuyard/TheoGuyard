I am currently a PhD candidate at INSA (MA team) and INRIA (SIMSMART team).
Before, I earned an Engineering degree (MSc. equivalent) in Applied Mathematics from INSA. 
There, I studied a wide range of applied mathematics fields such as Optimization, Machine Learning and Statistics, among many others. 
I also took a research option that allowed me to work with researchers for two years before obtaining my engineering degree. 
My main research topics are :

- Optimization (convex, non-convex, mixed-integer, ...)
- Sparse problems
- Screening methods
- Machine learning
- Signal processing
